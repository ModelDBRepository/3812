Example simulation produces a few curves from fig 4b.
Discrepancies may be due to differences between the
synapse file used by the figure and the synapse locations
defined in Files/meyLongSynfile3.hoc

mosinit.hoc and mosinit.ses file were created by Michael Hines.
In order to run the example, the last few lines of
sim_hoc_files/sim_ampa.hoc were commented out to avoid generating
a large number of results files. Also the mod files were moved out of
a Mod subdirectory and into the top directory to conform to the
policy of the mos2nrn autolaunch program.
